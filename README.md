Power-ups: Implement power-ups that appear when certain bricks are destroyed. These power-ups could provide temporary benefits like increasing paddle size, adding extra balls, slowing down the ball, or giving the ability to shoot projectiles to break bricks. Different Brick Types: Introduce different types of bricks with varying levels of durability. For example, regular bricks may require one hit to break, while tougher bricks may require multiple hits. Additionally, you could add indestructible bricks that cannot be destroyed. Level Design: Create multiple levels with different layouts of bricks. Increase the difficulty gradually by introducing more challenging arrangements of bricks. You can also design special levels with unique challenges or themes.
